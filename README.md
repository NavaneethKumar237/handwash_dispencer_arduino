# handwash_dispencer_arduino
In the wake of growing hygiene awareness, this project presents a smart, contactless hand wash dispenser designed to minimize germ transmission through automation. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect hand presence, automatically activates a sanitizer dispenser, and follows up with a short UV sterilization cycle to clean the dispensing area â€” all without requiring physical contact.
This project prioritizes both user convenience and safety, using a time-controlled relay system, visual feedback via an I2C LCD, and a buzzer alert to ensure intuitive operation. The system eliminates the need for manual buttons and maintains hygienic conditions by reducing touch points.
